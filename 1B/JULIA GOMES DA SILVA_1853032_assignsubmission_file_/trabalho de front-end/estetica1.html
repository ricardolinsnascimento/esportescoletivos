      <p><strong> – Pass </strong> </p>

      <p> When a player has possession of the ball, he can freely pass to a teammate, having to pass to the side or backwards, and never forwards.</p>

      <p><strong> – Knock-on </strong></p>

      <p> When a player who has the ball drops it and it touches the ground towards the opponent's field or just by touching it, an infraction is signaled, which is punished with a scrum for the opposing team and thus possession of ball is lost.</p>

      <p><strong> – Kick </strong></p>

      <p>This is the only way to be able to make some kind of throw in the direction of the opponent's field, being an option to pass or run with the ball. any player on their team in front of the ball at the time of the kick is out of play until they withdraw behind the kicker.</p>

      <p><strong> – Offside </strong></p>

      <p>A player is considered to be in an offside position when he is ahead of his teammate who carries the ball, or who played it last. Being offside is not considered an infraction, but an offside athlete cannot participate in any action until he returns to a playing position again. If a player who is out of play takes part in the actions, he may be penalized.</p>

      <p><strong> – Side Launch </strong></p>

      <p>A throw-in is taken when the ball goes off the sideline. Each team forms a line of players, and after the launch, each team tries to recover the ball. The throw must be straight and the jumpers can lean on other players in order to catch the higher throws. When in the air, they cannot be the victim of tackle or any disturbance such as pulling or pushing.</p>

      <p><strong> Contact Plays </strong></p>

      <p>As rubgy is an extreme contact sport, there are also several plays that consist of contact, being usually defensive.</p>

      <p><strong> – Tackle </strong></p>

      <p> The tackle is when one or more players charge against the opposing player who is in possession of the ball, making him touch his knees on the ground, sit or lie down, and to continue he must immediately release the ball. and the tackled player steps aside so other players can retrieve the ball.</p>

      <p><strong> – Ruck </strong></p>

      <p> A ruck is formed if the ball is on the ground and one or more athletes from both teams who are standing make contact around the ball. In this case, players cannot use their hands to handle the ball in the ruck. They must use their feet to move the ball into the ruck and can push opponents past the ball so that it emerges after the last foot and can be played with their hands.</p>

      <p><strong> – Maul </strong></p>

      <p> A Maul occurs when the ball carrier is held by one or more opposing players and one or more players on his team come into contact with him. The ball must not be in contact with the ground. The team in possession of the ball can try to gain territory by pushing its opponents towards the opposing in-goal line. The ball can be passed back and forth between the athletes in the maul and eventually passed to another player not participating in the maul, or a player can leave the maul with the ball and run with it.</p>

      <p><strong> – Scrum </strong></p>

      <p>The scrum is used to restart the game after an interruption of the game for a minor infraction or because it cannot be continued through the ruck or maul. Two lines of players in formation are formed and the ball is placed in their center by a player. After thrown, the Hooker of each team has the function of trying to throw the ball backwards with the feet to a teammate. Normally, it is the team that threw the ball who wins possession of the ball, because the Hooker and the player who threw the ball manage to synchronize.</p>
