	<h3>Step by Step</h3>
	<ul>	
		<li><p>Keep your legs straight, shoulder-width and arms half bent.</p></li>
		<li><p>Jump towards the ball while extending your arms and legs.</p></li>

	</ul>

	<p>Blocking is the excêncial defense action for a good game. As the name says, blocking is the action of blocking the opponent's attack. You can use up to three players, called single lock (one player), double (two players) and triple (three players).</p>

	<h3>Step by Step</h3>
	<ul>	
		<li><p>Lower and lean slightly forward</p></li>
		<li><p> When the ball is right in front of your eyes, stretch your legs to lift your body to the max </p></li>
		<li><p>Use thumbs indicators, ring and phalanges</p></li>
		<li><p>When touching the ball, rotate your fists and palms from the inside out, push the ball with your fingers hard, and at the end of the movement stretch your arms up.</p></li>
	</ul>
