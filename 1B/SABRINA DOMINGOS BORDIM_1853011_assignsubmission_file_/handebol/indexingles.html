    <h2>Which is?</h2>
	<p>Handball is widely practiced in schools, due to the use of indoor soccer courts, since the sport is based on soccer.
	The player moves the ball with his hands through passes until he reaches the opponent's goal area, only three steps are allowed with the ball in his hand, then the player has to pass it or throw it.
	Some situations, such as: taking more than three steps with the ball in hand, stepping in the goalkeeper's area, pulling the ball away from the opponent are considered as a foul penalized with a seven-meter throw.
	Handball provides physical, muscular and cardiovascular conditioning. The caloric expenditure for one hour corresponds to 750 kcal.</p>

	<h2>Handball Rules</h2>

	<p>	The objective of handball is to score goals. Therefore, the team that scores the most goals wins. For this, the skill and speed of the players favor the final result.
	When the ball is in the player's hand, he can take up to three steps before throwing it to another player.
	This also applies to time, that is, each player can keep it in their hands for 3 seconds. This makes handball a very dynamic game.</p>
