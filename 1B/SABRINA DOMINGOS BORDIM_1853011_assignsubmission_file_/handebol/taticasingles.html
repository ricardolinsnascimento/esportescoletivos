	<h3> Attack in zone 5-1 </h3>

	<p> Among all handball positions, the pivot is the one in which a player is positioned between opposing defenders. With this player as an offensive reference, the 5-1 scheme is used.
	The pivot always moves towards the ball, to facilitate the reception and, consequently, to shoot facing the opposing goalkeeper.
	While a center acts centrally, the other five players are divided between a center guard, two side guards and two wingers.
	The attacking team must always exchange passes and look for moves that create shooting opportunities. Among all handball positions, the pivot is one in which a player is positioned between the opposing defenders. With this player as an offensive reference, the 5-1 scheme is used.</p>

	<h3> Attack in zone 6-0 </h3>

	<p> The 6-0 tactical system is one of the simplest in handball. The team forms a line of six athletes in front of the opposing area. These athletes exchange passes and move around, to create opportunities for shots on goal or chances for penetration.
	In this formation, there is no pivot. In one of the alternatives, the owners seek to create alternatives on the one hand, forcing the defense to move in that direction. Thus, space is opened on the other side, for the completion of the move. In this case, the winger is the one who moves through the middle to occupy the position that would be the pivot.
	If the play starts in the middle, attacking players must exchange passes close to the midfield line, to avoid interceptions by defenders.</p>
	
	<h2>Tactical handball defense schemes</h2>

<ul> 
	<li> Scheme 6-0 </li>
	<li> Scheme 5-1 </li>
	<li> Scheme 3-2-1</li>
	<li> Scheme 3-3 </li>
	<li> Scheme 4-2 </li>
</ul>

	<h3>Scheme 6-0</h3>

	<figure>

	</figure>

	<p>The 6-0 is the most basic tactical scheme in handball. In it, all six court players are on the same defensive line. Positioned in front of the area, they try to block the opponents' shots.
	The two players who score in the middle of the court are number 3 athletes. Next to them, there are two number 2 players. At the ends of the courts, finishing the defensive line of six athletes, there are two number 1 players.
	Therefore, if an athlete says that he will play in position 1 on the left, it is possible to conclude that he will be on the left wing while his team is defending.</p>

	<h3>Scheme 5-1</h3>

	</figure>

	<p>In 5-1 handball defense, a player leaves the first defensive line to form a second line.
	The player who is the furthest forward is one of the two number 3 center players.
	As in the 6-0 scheme, the number 1 players are on the wings, while the number 2 players are between them and the number 3 athlete who forms the first defensive line with five athletes.</p>

	<h3>Scheme 3-2-1</h3>

	<figure>
		<img src="img/defesa3x2x1.jpeg"width="200" height="auto" alt="Scheme 3-2-1">
		<figcaption>defense scheme 3-2-1</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>In a 3-2-1 tactical formation, three players stand over the six-meter mark, while two others stand between six and nine meters. The sixth lineman, on the other hand, positions himself at the nine-meter mark.
	The objective of this tactical scheme is to take advantage of counterattacks with the most advanced players. On the other hand, the system requires a lot of movement from defenders, increasing physical wear.</p>

	<h3>Scheme 3-3</h3>

	<figure>
		<img src="img/defesa3x3.jpeg"width="200" height="auto" alt="Scheme 3-3">
		<figcaption>defense scheme 3-3</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>The 3-3 tactical system divides the players into two lines of three, with the intention of decreasing throws from the nine-meter line made by the opposing team.
	This is a formation considered aggressive, but risky, as it makes coverage difficult and can provide infiltration.
	During the match, this tactical system may change, and the team will start to position itself in a 3-2-1, 4-2 or even 5-1 formation.</p>

	<h3>Scheme 4-2</h3>

	<figure>
		<img src="img/defesa4x2.jpeg"width="200" height="auto" alt="Scheme 4-2">
		<figcaption>defense scheme 4-2</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>In the 4-2 tactical scheme, two defensive lines are formed. In the first, two players position themselves close to the nine-meter mark. The second has four defenders at the height of the six-meter mark.
	In this system, the objective is to avoid long and medium-distance throws. The defenders of the second line move in different directions.
	This tactical formation blocks mid-range shots and makes two-pivot actions difficult. On the downside, it's not as efficient a system to defend against attacks in 3-3.</p>
