	<h2><strong>A little about rugby</strong></h2> 
		<p>Rugby (in English, rugby, and in European Portuguese, rugby) was officially created in 1823 by British student William Webb, who, during a football match, would have picked up the ball with his hands and run to the goal.</p>
		<p> is a game in which an oval ball is carried by the players' feet or hands to the back line of the field, where there is an H-like beam.</p>
		<p> The main objective is to make a try, which consists of passing the ball through the baseline and touching the ground, the move that is worth the most points in the game.</p>
		<p> For its practice, the use of mouthguards is mandatory. Similar to American football, it was rugby that gave rise to it, which happened in 1860 when a group of students made changes to the rules of rugby because they didn't like the way it was played.</p>
		<p>The sport has different versions, the best known being Rugby XV, which has 15 players on each team, and Rugby Sevens, which has 7 players.</p>

	<h3> <strong>Rugby origin and history </strong> </h3>
		<p>The origin of rugby dates back to the Greeks and Romans, who played ball games, episkyros and harpastum, respectively.</p>
	    <p>According to the International Rugby Federation, its origin dates back to 1823, at the Rugby School, located in Rugby, England - hence the name of the sport. The person responsible for the emergence of the sport is William Webb Ellis.</p>
	    <p>At the time, there were no written rules for ball games. The rules were oral and each school had more or less its own way of playing. William did something different from what they did at his school, he ran with the ball in his hands instead of kicking it like they used to do.</p>
	    <p> In 1871, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was created in England - an entity responsible for organizing rugby, followed by the creation of similar entities in other countries. Then came the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) in 1873, the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) in 1879, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) in 1881, and the International Rugby Board (IRB), in 1886.</p>
	    <p>The first international dispute, in 1881, was between England and Scotland, in which the Scots were the winners.</p>
	    <p> Rugby has undergone several changes over the years. One of the most important concerns the score. Since 1992 the try is worth 5 points, but at the beginning, it wasn't worth any, and only in 1886 it started to count, but only 1 point. Today, the try is the best move</p>
