    <h1><strong> Rugby rules</strong></h1>
    <p> <a href="rugby.html"> back to home page</a> </p>
    <p> <a href="regras.html">back to the rules in portuguese</a> </p>
    <p>Before we start talking about the basic rules of Rugby, we need to understand and know that there are two ways to play: the first is known as Rugby XV and the other is Rugby Sevens.</p>
   
        <li><strong>Rugby XV</strong></li>
    <ul>
    	<li> Two teams of 15 players each</li>
    	<li>play 2 halves of 40 minutes on a 100m x 70m field.</li>

    </ul>
        <li><strong>Rugby Sevens</strong></li>
    <ul>
    	<li> Two teams of 7 players each</li>
    	<li>play 2 halves of 7 minutes on a 100m x 70m field.</li>
    
    </ul>

    <p>Now, on to the rules!</p>

        <li><strong>Rugby Basic Rules</strong></li>
    <ul>
    	<li>During the game of Rugby the ball can only be passed to the side or backwards, never forwards. Only forward kick is allowed.</li>
    	<li>Only the athlete who has the ball can be taken down, the action of taking down the opponent is called a tackle, however, contact can only be made from the chest line down.</li>

    </ul>
         <li><strong>plays and score</strong></li>
    <ul>
         <li>Try: To make a Try, the player needs to pass the opponent's goal line and put the ball on the ground. Each Try is worth 5 points.</li>
         <img src="img/try.jpg"  height="250px">
         <li>Conversion: Always after the try is marked, the team that scored is entitled to a kick to the Hs (Rugby goal). Remembering that in this case the ball is stopped on a support and is worth 2 points. Note: In Sevens mode the kick must be done as a Drop Goal.</li>
         <img src="img/conv.jpg" height="250px">
         <li>Penalty: Works in the same way as Conversion, but only after a serious foul.</li>
         <li>Drop Goal: It's a "ready hit" kick, where the ball must bounce before the kick and pass through the H, this kick can be given at any time in the game and is worth 3 points.</li>

    </ul>
         <li><strong>dead balls</strong></li>
    <ul>
         <li>Line-out: When the ball goes out to the side, two parallel lines are formed and the ball must be thrown between them. The team that catches the ball remains in possession.</li>
         <img src="img/line.jpg" height="200px">
         <li>Scrum: It is a form of restarting the game, whenever there is a slight infraction, for example, a forward pass. At that moment the team that did not commit the infraction puts the ball in the tunnel to win it back.</li>
