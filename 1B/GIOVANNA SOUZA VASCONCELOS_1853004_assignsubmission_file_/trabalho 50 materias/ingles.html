        <h2> Volleyball </h2>
        <p> Volleyball is a sport played between two teams on a rectangular court (open or closed). It is divided by a net placed vertically over the center line. Volleyball is played with a ball and includes several passes with the hands. The main objective is to throw the ball over the net and make it touch the opponent's ground.</p>
		<h2> The origin of volleyball </h2>
		<p> Volleyball was invented on February 9, 1895 by William George Morgan in the United States of America. Morgan, who worked at YMCA in Holyoke, Massachusetts, aimed to create a team sport with no physical contact between opponents in order to minimize the risk of injury. </p>
		<h2> History of volleyball in Brazil </h2>
		<p> Volleyball arrived in Brazil in 1915. It is not known for sure who brought the sport to the country, but it was in that year that the first volleyball match took place in the city of Recife, Pernambuco. However, the sport, which today is very widespread in the country, only began to gain strength in 1923. This is because in that year the first championship was organized in Rio de Janeiro, with Fluminense being the first professional Brazilian club created. From there, the sport grew and acquired fans and today it is widely practiced, especially in physical education classes. After football, volleyball is currently the most popular sport in Brazil. </p>
		<p> First, it began in the northeast, at Colégio Marista de Recife in 1925. In the following years, through the Young Men's Christian Association in the city of São Paulo, it began to spread to other states. </p>
		<p> In the beginning, this sport was considered especially for women. Because it was not very violent, men did not practice it. Over time, it was also spread among males and today, in addition to the court modality, volleyball is played on the beach (beach volleyball). </p>
		<h2> Rules of Volleyball </h2>
		<p> The main volleyball rules are: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Each team has a coach </li>
			<li> A match consists of 5 sets </li>
			<li> There is no predetermined time for each set </li>
			<li> Each set has a maximum of 25 points with a minimum difference of 2 points </li>
			<li> In case of a tie in the set at the end (24 x 24), the match continues until the difference of two points is reached (26 x 24, 27 x 25, etc.) </li>
			<li> After the service, the team can only touch the ball three times </li>
			<li> The team that wins three sets wins. </li>
			<li> If there is a tie in the sets (2x2) the 5th set will be final. </li>
		</ul>
		<h2> Volleyball Fundamentals </h2>
		<p> The fundamentals are the techniques and skills used by players. The main fundamentals are: serve, reception, set, attack, block and defense. </p>
		<h3> Serve </h3>
		<p> Each volleyball play starts with the serves. The server throws the ball and has to throw it over the net and into the opponent's court. If he exceeds the limit, the ball will return to his opponent to serve, when the ball touches the ground of the opposing team, points are scored. </p>
		<p> The so-called “service zone” represents the place where the server must remain to release the ball. This is a 9 meter wide area situated after each back line. </p>
		<h3> Reception </h3>
		<p> Players receive the serve through the reception ground, usually done through features such as the headline or touch. </p>
		<h3> Lifting </h3>
		<p> Lifters lift the ball with their fingertips. Then they pass to the attackers who try to score a point by throwing into the opponent's field. </p>
		<h3> Attack </h3>
		<p> The attackers put a lot of strength into the play and with a big jump they aim to touch the opposing team's ground to score the point. </p>
		<h3> Blocking or Defense </h3>
		<p>Opponents can perform a block or defense so that the ball comes back and touches the ground of the team that attacked. Blocks are performed by two or more players who are positioned close to the net, thus, to defend against the opponent's attack, they jump at the same moment.</p>
