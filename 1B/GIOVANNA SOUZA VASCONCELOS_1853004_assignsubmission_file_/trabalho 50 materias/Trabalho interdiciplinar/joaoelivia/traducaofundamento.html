        <p> The "pass" foundation basically involves two specific techniques:</p>
        <h3> Headline</h3>
        <p> It involves the player pushing the ball with the inside of the arms straight, usually with the legs bent and below the waist line;</p>
        <h3>Touch</h3>
        <p> In which the ball is manipulated with the fingertips above the head.  </p> 
        <h2> Withdraw: </h2>

        <p>The serve in volleyball is the act of sending the ball from the service area to the opponent's court. </p>
        <p>This action is performed by the player who occupies position 1, striking the ball loose in the air with the hand or part of the arm. The ball must be directed towards the opponent's court and pass over the net and between the antennas.</p>
        <h3>Observation:</h3>
        <p>If a service point is made, without the opposing defense being able to make the reception, it is called an ace. </p> 
        <h3>Withdraw from below:</h3>
        <p>It's the least powerful serve. The player must hold the ball with one hand and hit it with the other, open or closed, making an upward movement.
        </p>
        <h3>Withdraw from above:</h3>
        <p>It is the most used serve and in which the ball is thrown with force. In this type of service, the player must throw the ball upwards, with one hand, and hit it with the other.</p>
        <h3>Withdrawal on Suspension:</h3>
        <p>It's the most powerful serve. The player throws the ball upwards and, jumping, hits it as if he were going to make a cut, that is, in a movement from top to bottom.</p>
