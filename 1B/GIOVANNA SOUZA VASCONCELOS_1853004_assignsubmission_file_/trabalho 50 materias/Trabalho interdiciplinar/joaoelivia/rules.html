        <p>Court area: 18x9</p>
        <p>Net height: 2.24 for women's games and 2.43 for men's games</p>
        <p> Number of players: 12 players maximum, 6 effective and 6 substitutes</p>
        <h2>Point Marking:</h2> 
        <p>The team scores when:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Can make the ball touch the opposing team's court;</li>
            <li>The opposing team throws the ball out of the playing court;</li>
            <li>The opposing team commits a rule violation;</li>
            <li>The opposing team is penalized.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Meaning of Rally in volleyball:</h2>
        <p> Rally in volleyball is all the actions that take place in the game from the moment a service takes place until the moment a team scores a point. With each new service a new rally is started. If the serving team wins a rally, it earns a point and the same player continues to serve. If the team receiving the service wins a rally, it will score a point and must execute the next service.</p>
        <h2>Number of sets in a volleyball match:</h2> 
            <ul>
                <li>A volleyball match has a minimum of 3 sets and a maximum of 5 sets;</li>
                <li>The team that first scores 25 points with a difference of 2 points wins a set in volleyball;</li>
                <li>If the game is tied at 24 to 24, the set will continue beyond 25 points until a team manages to open the 2 points difference and win the set. Ex: 26 to 24, 25 to 27, 28 to 26 etc...;</li>
                <li>The team that first wins 3 sets will win the match;</li>
                <li>In the event of a tie in 2 sets to 2, the tiebreaker set or 15-point tie-break will be played.</li>
            </ul> 
        <h2>Initial team positioning: </h2>
        <p>Each team must always have six players on the playing court. The initial positioning of the players indicates their rotation order on the court. This order must be maintained throughout the set and can only be changed at the beginning of a new set. When the ball is put into play by the server, each team must be positioned within its own playing court, (except the server) in the order of service. After the service hit, players can move and occupy any position on their own court.</p>
        <p> The positions of the players are: three players are positioned along the net, form the attack line and occupy the positions: 4 NET ENTRY (attack-left); 3 NET HALF (attack-center) and 2 NET OUTPUT (attack-right).</p>
        <p>The other three players are the defensive players and occupy the following positions: 5 BACK IN (left-back), 6 MIDDLE (center-back) and 1 BACK OUT (right-back).</p>

        <h2>Rotation:</h2> 
        <p>The rotation of players is determined by the starting line-up, controlled by the order of service and the position of the players, during the set. When the receiving team wins the right to serve, its players rotate, advancing one position, always clockwise.</p>
        <p>The player in position 2 goes to position 1 in order to serve; the player in position 1 goes to position 6, and so on.</p>
