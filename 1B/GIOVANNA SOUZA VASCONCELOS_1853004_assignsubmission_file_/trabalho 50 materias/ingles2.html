		<p> The service is considered the first attack, because it is the foundation that starts the game or the rally - which comprises the moment when the referee whistles until a point is scored. To execute a service, the server holds the ball with one hand and hits it with the other to throw it over the net towards the opponent's court. If the ball touches the opponent's court, the team scores a point, but if the ball goes far and leaves the court, the opposing team serves again. A serve whose ball hits the net earns the opposing team a point. </p>
		<p> The main types of serve in volleyball are: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Serve from below: This is the least powerful serve. The player must hold the ball with one hand and the battery with the other, open or closed, making an upward movement. </li>
			<li> Overhead serve: it is the most used serve in which the ball is thrown with force. In this type of service, the player must throw the ball upwards, with one hand, and hit it with the other. </li>
			<li> Suspended Loot (known as "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"): This is the most powerful loot. The player throws the ball upwards and, jumping, hits it as if to make a cut, in a movement from top to bottom. </li>
			<li> Side serve: Its execution is similar to the serve from below, with the difference that the arm used to hit the ball moves laterally. In addition, the athlete stands sideways towards the court, with the feet pointed towards the destination of the throw. Its objective is to make reception difficult with the effect of the ball. </li>
			<li> Floating serve: Instead of force, the player chooses to take the weight off the ball and decrease its rotation, hitting it lighter. Despite leaving at a lower speed, he complicates the opponent by his curve and fast downward movement. </li>
		</ul>

		</figure>
		<p>The defensive play that receives the serve is called the reception. A well-done reception allows for a better performance in the team's attack. Reception is usually performed through touch or headline. </p>
		<p>Touch is not a foundation, but a resource that allows you to put the fundamentals of volleyball into practice. The headline is a feature where the player receives the ball with the forearms outstretched and both hands joined by the thumbs. It serves to receive serves, as well as to defend attacks and to not let a ball that is below the player's waist fall to the ground. </p>
		<h2 id=lifting> Lifting </h2>

		</figure>
		<p> Lifting is the foundation on which players try to lift the ball to assist the forwards to return the ball to the opponent's court trying to score. A good set can guarantee the success of the offensive play, which is why the setter plays one of the most important roles on the team. </p>
		<h2 id=attack> Attack </h2>

			<figcaption> Attack Movement </figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p> The attack is the foundation that usually ends a rally. </p> 
		<p> There are several types of attack: </p> 
		<ul>
			<li> high ball attack at the ends: It is considered the safest, because it takes the longest. Not being an immediate play allows players to study the plays in progress, for this reason, this type of attack is also called a safety ball.</li>
			<li> fastball attack on the extremities </li>
			<li> fastball attack in the middle </li>
			<li> back court attack: It is a good attack alternative, since it is not carried out from the attacking zone, but from the defense zone, that is, from the back of the court.</li>
			<li> middle attack </li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id=block> Block </h2>
		<figure>
			<img src= "img/zyro-image.png" width="200" alt="volleyball block image">
			<figcaption> Blocking movement </figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p> Blocking is the play that tries to prevent the ball thrown by the opponent from crossing the net and reaching the side of the court of the other team. The block tries to make the ball hit the floor of the opponent's court to score a point. </p>
		<p> The player (or players) positions himself close to the net to prevent the ball from advancing. The blocking player's hands and arms may advance the opponent's net, but only for the purpose of blocking the passage of the ball. In no other case is it allowed to advance the opponent's space. </p>
		<h2 id=defense> Defense </h2>
		<figure>

		<p> Defense is an action that aims to prevent the opposing team's attack from resulting in a point. Blocking can be considered a defensive action when it aims to dampen the opponent's attack and thus facilitate reception. The libero is a player who performs only defensive actions, using headlines and touch to perform them. </p>
