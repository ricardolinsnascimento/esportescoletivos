    	<h2>Defense Tactics</h2>
    	<p><strong>1. Individual defense</strong></p>
    	<p>It is the oldest type of basketball defense, implemented by creator James Naismith in the late 19th century. In this type of marking, each player is responsible for an opponent and must be in the space between him and the basket. The main objective is to follow your movements and avoid scoring. In general, the point guard of one team marks the point guard of the other and so on â€” it is up to the coach to find the best confrontations to nullify the opponent's power. In this type of defense, it is necessary to focus on the player's steps, without losing the reference of the basket and the rest of the team.</p>
    	<p><strong>2. Defense by zone</strong></p>
    	<p>The zone is one of the most complex defensive tactics in basketball, but it is effective when trained well. In it, players do not have a specific combination, but are responsible for occupying spaces on the court. One of its benefits is the numerical advantage in the lane, which facilitates the rebound and makes infiltrations difficult. On the other hand, the high movement of players can leave holes and there is also a greater vulnerability for long-distance shots. Therefore, the teacher must seek the chemistry of his students and ensure that everyone is well trained before applying zone defense in a match..</p>
    	<p><strong>3. Mixed defense</strong></p>
    	<p>Mixed defense is a combination of individual marking and zone marking. That is, in the same play, some players are responsible for specific opponents, while others occupy specific spaces on the court. Its advantage is the change in the pace of play, which can confuse the other team. The Diamond is one of the techniques used in mixed defense. In her they are four players in the zone, but in a 2-2 scheme. The other structure of mixed defense is the Triangle, in which two players score individually and the other three are divided, positioning themselves in a zone.</p>
    	<p><strong>4. Defense pressure</strong></p>
    	<p>The pressure defense is used in specific moments of the game, as in the final minutes when the score is unfavorable. Its main characteristic is to have a numerical advantage and force the opponent to make quick decisions, which can lead to errors and the resumption of possession. It is possible to use both individual and zone marking. Physical conditioning should receive more attention from the coach, since the team will have a greater wear to pressure the opponent. In addition, it is necessary to avoid harsher contacts, as this combative posture can generate infractions and free throws. Finally, it is necessary to have a good rapport so as not to leave empty spaces.</p>
    	<p><strong>5. Boxe one</strong></p>
    	<p>In this defense nomenclature, the positioning adopted by players with four defenders per zone, 2-2 in a square. It consists of marking the player individually. Such a technique is a good option to be adopted when the attacking team also has good pivots and the rest of the team does not offer risks for the shots.</p>
    	<p><strong>6. Diamond one</strong></p>
    	<p>The objective of the diamond one defense technique is the same as that of boxing one. What changes is the positioning of the four defensive players. It works like a diamond, 1-2-1. This is done so that the defense has a strategic position and the opposing players are not able to score points. This type of method is widely used when some other attacker, who is not the ace, has a good shot. In this way, there is a need to have defenders positioned to make their mark. If there are good pivots in the attack, marking only one player, the back is very vulnerable.</p>
    	<p><strong>7. Triangle two</strong></p>
    	<p>In triangle two, the defense is very similar to boxing one and diamond. But defenders score individually, 1-2, forming a triangle. The main purpose of this technique is to prevent the two individually marked players from scoring points and limit the shots of the others. That way the three attackers won't be able to score points.</p> </ab><br>
    	<h2>attack tactics</h2>
    	<p><strong>1- Classic:</strong></p>
    	<p>When the team organizes its attack strictly following the characteristics mentioned in the article about basketball positions. Basically it works with three men on the perimeter (positions 1, 2 and 3) and two in the lane (positions 4 and 5).</p>
    	<p><strong>
        2- Four open:</strong></p>
    	<p>It is used when the Libero (pivot wing) does not have the characteristic of acting in the lane, due to injury, when the coach is forced to improvise a lateral in this position. It is also used in the game situation, where the opposing team is pressure-marking the entire court and the coach takes a pivot, putting a second point guard to help with the pressure release. This formation works with athletes in positions 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the perimeter and only those in position 5 in the lane.</p>
    	<p><strong>3- Three in the demijohn:</strong></p>
    	<p>When the defending team does not have tall athletes, and the attacking team has at least three attackers larger than the defenders, the coach evaluates the greatest advantage in the proportion: height-defender-attacker, using up to three pivots. those attackers who will have greater physical advantage, close to the basket, in order to receive the pass and finish or at least receive a foul. It is characterized by only the attackers in position 1 and 2 being on the perimeter and those in position 3, 4 and 5 in the lane.</p>
    	<p><strong>4- Five open:</strong></p>
    	<p>This training is quite radical. It is rarely used throughout the game. It is usually adopted in the game situation, when the attacking team is in despair, trying to decrease the score and only looking for the definitions of three points. Usually the coach replaces the pivots, putting in good pitchers and all the forwards are positioned on the perimeter.</p>
