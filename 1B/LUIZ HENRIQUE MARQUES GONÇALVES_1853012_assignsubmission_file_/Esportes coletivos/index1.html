		<h2>Origin and History</h2>
			<p>Basketball, or simply basketball, is a team sport played between two teams. It is played with a ball, where the objective is to insert it into the fixed basket that is located at the ends of the court. Basketball is currently one of the most popular Olympic games in the world. In schools, it is one of the most practiced sports in physical education classes.</p>
			<p>Basketball was created in 1891 by Canadian Physical Education teacher James Naismith (1861-1940). The sport emerged as an alternative to the region's harsh winter, to the detriment of others practiced outdoors such as baseball and football.
			Also, the original idea was to create a sport less violent than football. Allied to this, the creator teacher intended to integrate the students in physical education classes and stimulate the collectivity of the groups.</p>
			<p>The first official basketball game was played in 1892, and had an audience of approximately 200 people. Only later did basketball appear in the Olympics. The first Olympic basketball game took place at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.
			This moment represented a great achievement for the dissemination of the sport around the world. </p>
			<p>Today, around 200 countries are affiliated to FIBA, the International Basketball Federation. This organization was founded in 1932 and is responsible for organizing basketball-related events worldwide. Currently, its headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
			<p>The National Basketball Association is the premier professional basketball league in North America. With 30 franchises, the NBA is also considered the premier basketball league in the world.</p>
