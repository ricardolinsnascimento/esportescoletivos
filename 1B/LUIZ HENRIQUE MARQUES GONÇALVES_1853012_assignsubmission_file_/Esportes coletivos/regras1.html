      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p><strong>Rule #1: Team formation</strong></p>
      <p>Each basketball team must have 5 players. Thus, a match has 10 athletes in total. On the bench, between 3 and 7 players must be available, at most.</p> <br>
      <p><strong>Rule #2: start of the match</strong></p>
      <p>The match starts in the center of the court, with the coach tossing the ball up, while one player from each team tries to catch it.</p> <br>
      <p><strong>Rule #3: duration of the match</strong></p>
      <p>Each match lasts 40 minutes, divided into blocks of 10 minutes each. When the ball leaves the court, the clock is paused. That's why many basketball games last well over 40 minutes. If the ball is not in play, if there is a foul that stops the game, the clock stops marking the time and returns when everything comes back, everything is resolved. The clock continues to keep time and, only at the end, the referee grants some extra minutes to compensate for periods of long pauses in the game. Another characteristic regarding time in basketball is that a shot continues to count, even after the end of the game. For example, if a player shoots a ball to the opponent's basket in the last second of the game, his point is accepted even if the game time is exceeded.</p> <br>
      <p><strong>Rule No. 4: Points</strong></p>
      <p>Now let's go to one of the most common doubts when we talk about basketball rules. A lot of people think that every ball that enters the basket is worth a point with the same value, but that's not how it works. The markings on the court help us to understand this better. Baskets, as the shots that become points are called, can be worth 3, 2 or 1 point. The baskets worth 3 points are those made by the player outside the half circle who is in the defense on each side of the court. It's a little more difficult, so the point is worth more. The baskets worth 2 points are those made inside the half circle, which are a little more accessible to players in terms of distance from the target, in this case, the basket. Finally, we have the basket worth 1 point. They are free throws, made from a fixed point on the court and which derive from some penalty, that is, fouls.</p> <br>
      <p><strong>Rule No. 5: Fouls or Penalties</strong></p>
      <p>There are basically two types of fouls: physical and technical. Physical fouls happen when a player touches the other, preventing his play, either to another teammate or to the basket. Therefore, players must mark their opponents with their hands behind or up. The arms cannot be open in an attempt to prevent the other's passage. Technical fouls happen when the player commits some act of insubordination on the court, either against the general rules of the game or directly hitting another player. In short, it would be bad behavior by the player. Each athlete can commit up to 4 physical faults and remain in the game. After the fifth foul, he is expelled from the match. In the case of technical fouls, 2 player faults already eliminate him from the game. However, unlike football, the expelled athlete can be substituted. That way, the team is not understaffed. We also have team fouls, which involve all players. Each team can commit up to 5 fouls for each 10-minute period. From the 6th foul, the opposing team is entitled to two free throws which, as we have seen, are worth 1 point each.</p> <br>
      <p><strong>Rule #6: Free Throws</strong></p>
      <p>As we have seen, free throws are shots from a fixed point on the court and that happen when the player suffers a penalty. The number of free throws this player is entitled to depends on the type of foul he receives. Thus, if the player is commonly fouled, he is entitled to a free throw. If the foul prevented him from completing a basket, the player may make two free throws. And, if the foul did not allow the player to make a three-pointer, he will be entitled to the execution of three free throws.</p> <br>
      <p><strong>Rule n°7: Replacement of the ball on the court</strong></p>
      <p>When the basket occurs, the ball must be returned to play from the back of the court and possession belongs to the team that suffered the point. When a foul occurs, the throw-in is from the side of the court.</p> <br>
      <p><strong>Rule #8: Rule of Seconds</strong></p>
      <p>You can already see that every second in basketball is worth a lot. A match can be set at the second end of the game. And the seconds are also used to control the possession and use of the ball inside the court. Check it out: 3 seconds: it's the maximum time that the player, without possession of the ball, can stay inside the defense area of ​​the other team, called the big bottle. 5 seconds: it's the maximum time that the player can keep the ball in hands, before throwing it to a teammate.8 seconds: is the time that the team has available to make an attack on the opposing team.24 seconds: is the maximum time available that the team has to throw the ball in the basket .</p> <br>
      <p><strong>Rule #9: There's no tie</strong></p>
      <p>In basketball, the game cannot end in a tie. If this happens, the teams have 5 more minutes of play to decidewho is the winner.</p> <br>
