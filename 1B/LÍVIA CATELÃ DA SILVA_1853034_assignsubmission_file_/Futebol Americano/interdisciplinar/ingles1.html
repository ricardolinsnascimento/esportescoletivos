      <h3> American football or simply football, as it is known in the United States, is a competitive team sport, each consisting of 11 players on each side. It's a game that demands speed, agility, tactical ability and strength from players who push, block, chase each other trying to advance a ball into enemy territory during an hour of game time.

Despite this, there is strategy and planning, each team is made up of up to 40 athletes, including a defense team, an attack team and a third team of specialists, such as athletes trained only to kick the ball.

The game lasts 1 hour, being divided into two halves separated by an interval. Each half consists of two quarters lasting 15 minutes. The objective of the game is to get the ball to the end of the opponent's field and score points. American football is an aerobic sport that moves all the limbs of the body, increasing breathing capacity. </h3>
