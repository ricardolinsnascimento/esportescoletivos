    <h2><strong>RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Rhythmic gymnastics is a type of gymnastics developed with body movements based on elements of ballet and theatrical dance, in a mixture of art, creativity and physical ability, whose execution is performed in sync with the music.
    This branch of gymnastics, also called Sport Rhythmic Gymnastics - GRD, was recognized as an essentially female sport in 1962 by the International Gymnastics Federation. Therefore, at the Olympics and Championships only women participate in the competition individually or as a team.
    Rhythmic gymnastics presentations vary between 2min15s and 2min30s for teams and between 1min15s and 1min30s for individual performances.</strong></p>
    <h2><strong>HISTORY OF RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS: ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Mixing the movements of traditional gymnastics with dance, rhythmic gymnastics emerged, which began to be recognized at the end of the First World War, during the 20's by gymnastics schools, even without defined rules.
    In the 18th century, the attempt to add emotion to the execution of movements led Jean Georges Noverre and François Delsarte to idealize “modern gymnastics”, also called “expressive gymnastics”, under the influence of the Munich Expressionist Movement.
    The first outstanding steps in rhythmic gymnastics were taken by the choreographer Émile Jacques Dalcroze, idealizing the rhythmic technique, which was perfected by his student Rudolf Bode and developed by the dancer Isadora Duncan.
    Heinrich Medeau was responsible for including devices, such as the bow, ball and club, in the execution of rhythmic body movements.
    In 1961, the International Gymnastics Federation incorporated this type of gymnastics into competitions and established the first Technical Commission of the International Gymnastics Federation.
    Initially, the competitions were held by Eastern European countries, until in 1963 the first world championship with this modality was held in Budapest.
    After that, the modality continued to evolve with the insertion of more elements and the creation of regulations with international standards.
    Rhythmic gymnastics with the use of equipment was called Sport Rhythmic Gymnastics - GRD in 1975. Almost 10 years later, in 1984, this modality, performed individually, was included in the Olympic Games in Los Angeles. In 1996, the collective category also became part of the competition.</strong></p>
    <h2><strong>BEGINNING OF RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS IN BRAZIL</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Rhythmic gymnastics was introduced in Brazil by the Hungarian teacher and technician Ilona Peuker, through the creation of her own school for the movement.
    His contribution to the development of the modality in Brazil took place through the provision of courses to gymnasts and education professionals.
    In 1956, Dona Ilona, ​​as she became known, founded the first Brazilian team of Rhythmic Gymnastics, the GUG - Grupo Unido de Ginastas. In Brazil, the modality championships were first held in Rio de Janeiro.
    The Brazilian Gymnastics Confederation - CBG was created on November 25, 1978, with Dr. Siegfried Fischer. From 1978 to 1984, Ilona Peuker was president of the Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee.
    Brazil's first participation in a world championship took place in 1971 in Copenhagen, Denmark.</strong></p>
    <h2><strong>CHARACTERISTICS OF MOVEMENTS IN RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Rhythmic gymnastics is strongly influenced by artistic language, such as theater, music and dance, in an arduous work of physical, creative and affective preparation.
    The movement technique is based on expressive and rhythmic body movements to the sound of a theme song for ease on the platform. Body elements are evaluated by body balance, flexibility and rotations.
    The elements that involve the modality are the free hand movements, without the use of devices, and the use of the five official materials: bow, ball, rope, clubs and ribbon.</strong></p>
