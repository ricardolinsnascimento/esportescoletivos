   <p><strong>BODY ELEMENTS</strong></p>
   <h2>JUMPS</h2>

   <p><strong>For the judges to consider a jump to be valid, it must be of a height suitable for the stature of the gymnast and the apparatus used, and the gymnast's center of gravity must be sufficiently high. The shape of the body during the jump must be well defined, as well as the definition of its amplitude. The arrival on the ground is also very important as a very strong descent can lead to a penalty. These elements must be used with the string or bow.</strong></p>
   <h2>BALANCE</h2>

   	<figcaption>photo balance rhythmic gymnastics</figcaption>
   </figure>
   <p><strong>It consists of forming a static position in an exercise. This position should be maintained for at least one second and supported by the toes or one knee. Gymnasts must never perform unnecessary movements during, before or at the conclusion of the exercise, nor may they use their hands or the apparatus for support. The devices to be used in the balance elements are the ball or the clubs.</strong></p>
   <h2>PIVOTS</h2>

   	</figure>
    <p><strong>This body rotation must start from a static position, and it must go a little beyond 360º to be considered a complete turn or more than 720º to be a complete double turn. The pivot must be executed on tiptoe and the body shape must be maintained until the end of the rotation. Loss of balance and heel support during rotation are two serious faults in this element, which must be performed in the exercises with the tape.</strong></p>
    <h2>FLEXIBILITY</h2>

  	</figure>
    <p><strong>These elements consist of obtaining a very extended position to attest to the gymnast's flexibility. Thus, they must have an amplitude considered satisfactory and a well-defined body shape to be considered valid. A loss of balance or not placing the head in the joint movement are frequent faults in an exercise that can be applied to any apparatus.</strong></p>
