     <h1><strong>RHYTHMIC-TACTIC GYMNASTICS</strong></h1>
     <h2>TO IMPROVE A GYMNASTY PERFORMANCE, THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT POINTS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED:</h2> 
 <ul>
     <li><strong>Understanding and mastering the different techniques is essential to avoid making mistakes that can be penalized in the final score; </strong></li>
     <li><strong>Some elements are more important than others, but they can also be more difficult or risky and may not match the chosen choreography;</strong></li>
     <li><strong>The gymnast should focus on the most difficult elements that are worth more points, but also require more effort and training;</strong></li> 
     <li><strong>The connecting elements should not be forgotten, as they are the ones that give rhythm and balance to the entire exercise, being fundamental for a good performance; </strong></li>
     <li><strong>Some elements can be executed in an unclear way, which can later cause problems of interpretation on the part of the referees; it is necessary to interpret all the elements in a clear and simple way so that there are no doubts;</strong></li>
     <li><strong>A very good presentation is not easy, but it is not impossible either, it just takes a lot of dedication, effort and training.</strong> </li>
 </ul>
