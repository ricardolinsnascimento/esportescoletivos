		<h2 id="whatis">What is rugby and its purpose?</h2>
		<p>Rugby is a game in which an oval ball is carried by the players' feet or hands to the back line of the field, where there is an H-like beam. <br>The main objective is to make a try, which consists of passing the ball through the baseline and touching the ground, the move that is worth the most points in the game.</p> <br>

		<h2 id="origin">Sport Origin</h2>
		<p>According to the rugby portal, its origin dates back to the 19th century, approximately in 1845, in England, in the city of Rugby. As the story goes, apparently 3 boys from this town wrote the rules of what is now the sport, but this story is not fully confirmed. This sport is often confused with American football, however, although American football comes from rugby, there is a big difference in the way it is played, in the rules, etc. Its main difference is the objective, while in American football the objective would be to gain territory, in rugby the objective is to carry the ball to a certain area.</p>


		<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
		
		<ul>
		<li ><strong>Pass</strong></li> 
	    <p>One of the main rules in rugby is the pass, the ball pass must always be made to the player who is on the same line as the ball or behind it, never forward.</p> <br>

	    <li><strong>Physical contact</strong></li> 
	    <p>Another rule is physical contact, only the athlete who has the ball can be taken down, the action of taking down the opponent is called a tackle, however, contact can only be made from the chest line down. Knocking down a player who does not have possession of the ball is a penalty, as is knocking down a player with the ball on the chest line up. Other causes of penalty are obstructing the passage of a player from the opposing team or a player holding the ball when it falls to the ground.</p> <br>
