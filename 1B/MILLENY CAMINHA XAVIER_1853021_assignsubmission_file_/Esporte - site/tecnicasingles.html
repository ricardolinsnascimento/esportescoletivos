        <h2>Volleyball techniques</h2>

        <h3>WHAT ARE THE TECHNIQUES OF VOLLEYBALL?</h3>
        <p>The Main Techniques of Volleyball are Looting or Service, Reception or Pass, Lifting, Attack (Cut), Lock and Defense.</p>

        <h3>VOLLEYBALL DRAWING TECHNIQUE:</h3>
        <p>Looting or Service is one of the main techniques of Volleyball, is the act of putting the ball into play. In the language of Volleyball, Looting is the foundation that starts a Rally. A well-executed Draw is one that makes it difficult for the opposing team to receive a Pass, which will cause the receiving team's players to have to move away from their positions and thus have more difficulty performing an Attack.
        <p>"Rally in Volleyball are all actions that take place in the game from the moment a loot happens to the moment a team scores a point. With each new loot a new Rally is started."</p>

        <p>According to the FIVB Volleyball Rules, the drawer player must be behind the bottom line of his court, a region called the looting zone or service.</p>

        <h3>DRAWING RULES:</h3>

        <p>"The Looting or Service Zone in Volleyball is an area 9 meters wide behind the Background Line on either side of the court."</p>
        <h3>VOLLEYBALL DRAWING TYPES:</h3>
        <p>There are three types or styles of Looting in volleyball: the Looting from Below, the Looting from Above, and the Looting from Above with Hop or Looting Journey to the Bottom of the Sea (Looting Trip).</p>

        <h3>THE DRAWING BELOW:</h3>
        <p>It is a type of slower looting, in which the ball travels higher over the net. It is the most suitable loot for beginners in Volleyball.<p>

        <h3>DRAWING TECHNIQUE BELOW:</h3>
        <p>If you're right-handed, hold the ball in your left hand at the height of your waist, with your right hand closed with your thumb out and tap the bottom of the ball with enough force to get it over the net and into the opposing court. If you're left-handed, just make the same move by reversing your hands.</p>

        <h3>DRAWING OVER:</h3>
        <p>Looting from above is a faster, more efficient looting, even used by professional players.</p>

        <h3>TOP DRAWING TECHNIQUE:</h3>
        <p>Hold the ball with one or both hands, toss it up, over the head, hit the ball with the palm of your hand.</p>

        <h3>THE VOLLEYBALL RIDE:</h3>
        <p>The Loot Travel a Loot very fast and efficient, the most used in the professional level of Volleyball.</p>

        <h3>TRAVEL DRAWING TECHNIQUE:</h3>
        <p>The player must stay a few steps away from the bottom line, throw the ball high and forward, run, jump and hit the ball with the palm of the hand with the greatest possible power.</p>

        <h3>RECEPTION OR PASS TECHNIQUE IN VOLLEYBALL:</h3>
        <p>Reception or Pass is one of the basic foundations of Volleyball, it is the act of receiving the opposing Loot and passing the ball to the team lifter. The Reception or Pass is the first of three Ringtones allowed for each team.</p>

        <p>The most common technique used in the pass is the Headline (see image above). It is important that during the running of the Headline the ball is played with the forearm.</p>

        <h3>VOLLEYBALL LIFTING TECHNIQUE:</h3>
        <p>The Survey is usually the second touch of the three touches allowed for each team. The technique most used to perform a Survey is Touch (see image). However, the Survey can also be performed from Headlines.</p>

        <p>The goal of the Survey is to lift the ball next to the net so that a teammate can perform an Attack.</p>

        <p>Leveling-related Rules</p>

        <p>"If the Liber is in the Attack Zone and does a Lift using Touch, his teammates cannot cut the ball above the top of the Net."</p>

        <h3>ATTACK OR VOLLEYBALL-CUT TECHNIQUE:</h3>
        <p>Attack is most often the third touch of the ball allowed to each team. The technique most used in carrying out the Attack is the Cut. Offense is usually done by jumping and hitting the ball with the palm of the hand, with the greatest possible force and down.</p>

        <h3>STARTING OR STARTING TECHNIQUE IN VOLLEYBALL:</h3>
        <p>A Jump is a type of attack that does not use force, it is when a player jumps to perform an attack and, instead of performing a Jump, touches the ball with his fingertips in order to deflect the opponent's Lock.</p>

        <h3>VOLLEYBALL BLOCKING TECHNIQUE:</h3>
        <p>The Lock (see image) is a defense base that aims to block the Attack and send the ball back to the opposing court.</p>

        <p>Lock can be individual (single-player), double (two-player), or triple (three-player).</p>

        <p>Lock-Related Rules</p>

        <p>"Blocking Opposing Draw is forbidden"</p>
    
        <p>“The Libero cannot block or attempt to block”</p>

        <h3>DEFENSE TECHNIQUES IN VOLLEYBALL:</h3>
        <p>The Defense is a foundation that can be performed with any part of the body, including the feet. The objective of the Defense is to prevent the success of the Attack (Slash or Drop) of the opposing team.</p>

        <p>Defense is such an important foundation in Volleyball that there is a specialist in defense, the Libero.</p>
