		<p>Created in 1895, in the United States, by William George Morgan (1870-1942), the first name of volleyball was “mintonette”. Morgan's upbringing, who was a physical education teacher, was influenced by a number of factors, such as: having a game in which the risk of injury was reduced; in physical terms, it didn't demand much from the participants; could be played indoors and simply to innovate your classes.</p>

		<h2>The arrival of volleyball in several countries of the world</h2>
        <p>From the United States, volleyball went to Canada before conquering the world, arriving in South America in 1910. The first South American country to know about it was Peru, and in 1915 it was Brazil's turn, country where, in 1951, the first South American volleyball championship was played. It was probably also in 1915 that beach volleyball took its first steps in the United States, on the beautiful beaches of Hawaii, where it emerged as a summer hobby. In Brazil, 15 years later, in 1930, beach volleyball began to be played on the beaches of Rio. Interestingly, volleyball was the hobby of soldiers in both the first and second world wars. On April 20, 1947, the French volleyball federation, the FIVB - Fédération Internationale de Volleyball, was founded, whose first president was Paul Libaud. Currently counting with 163 member countries, it had the following 14 members when it was founded: Brazil, Belgium, Egypt, United States, France, Netherlands, Hungary, Italy, Yugoslavia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Uruguay. Even today the FIVB is the body responsible for all matters involving the sport, such as the organization of tournaments and congresses, courses for referees and coaches, and everything else that involves the promotion of volleyball worldwide. Two years after the foundation of the Federation, in 1949, the first men's volleyball championship was held in Czechoslovakia, which was won by the Russians. In 1952 it was the women's turn to compete for the first time in a volleyball championship, the title being won by the Japanese. Almost 70 years after its creation, starting in 1964, volleyball became part of the Olympic Games. Russia was the first Olympic champion in men's volleyball, with Czechoslovakia taking the silver and Japan the bronze. For the first time, in 1976, a volleyball game was televised to the world. With the team that became known as Geração de Prata, Brazil was the first South American country to win an Olympic medal in volleyball. The feat was achieved at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984, when Brazilians won the silver medal. Its importance was so great that the achievement was celebrated as if it were a gold medal. In the following Olympics, in 1988, Brazil did not win any medals, until it won gold in 1992.</p>

        <h2>What has changed in volleyball since its inception?</h2>
        <p>The first ball used in volleyball was very heavy, which is why Morgan requested that a ball be created with a specific size and weight for this sport. She was 67 cm in circumference and weighed a maximum of 340 g. Today, the ball has a circumference of 65 cm to 67 cm, weighing between 260 and 280 g, and has to be colored so that it can be identified more easily. The court was 15 meters long by 7.60 meters wide. As for the net, it measured 8.3 m in length with a width of 0.61 m, with 1.98 m from the ground. Today, the official court measures 18 x 9 m, and the net measures between 9.5 and 10 m and is placed at a height of 2.43 m for men's matches and 2.24 m for women's matches.</p>
