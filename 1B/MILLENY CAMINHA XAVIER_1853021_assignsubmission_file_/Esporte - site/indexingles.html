		<h2>Volleyball Origin: </h2>
        <p> William George Morgan, teacher and director of Physical Education at the Young Men's Christian Association (ACM), devised a game in which the probability of participants being injured, at the expense of physical contact, was low. Another important factor - and thought of older players - was that the sport was not so physically demanding. At the time, basketball was in vogue. It had been created 4 years earlier, also by a physical education teacher from the Young Men's Christian Association, who invented the sport as an alternative to more violent games such as baseball and football. And so came the volleyball - called "mintonette" - which, thanks to the fact that each team was separated by a net, brought less chance of injury. Also, it was less physically demanding than basketball - since players didn't have to run throughout the game all over the court. Volleyball, however, was very complete, as it comprised a series of exercises beneficial to health. Other factors that contributed to the invention of volleyball were Morgan's intention to innovate his classes so that he could captivate more students, and the fact that volleyball could be practiced in the harsh winter of the United States - since it was played in a closed court. The ball used in the game would be the next challenge. Using only the basketball's air chamber at first, Morgan tried to make the ball smaller and lighter. But this was not enough, and Morgan asked the firm A.G. Spalding & Bros. the creation of a specific ball, so that after several attempts they managed to obtain a ball with the ideal size and weight for volleyball practice. Then it was time to deal with the rules of the game. To do so, Morgan asked two friends, Dr. Frank Wood and John Lynch. In the following year of its creation, Morgan was invited to make a demonstration of the sport in a meeting promoted by the Christian Association of the Young Men. It was, in fact, the Congress of Physical Education Teachers, which brought together the physical education counselors of the ACM. On that occasion, the change of the name “mintonette” to “volley ball” was suggested by Professor Alfred T. Halstead, because the movements of the new game suggested this, a volley, that is, a move made in the air. After the advisors received a copy of the game rules, a team was responsible for studying them and suggesting improvements.</p>
