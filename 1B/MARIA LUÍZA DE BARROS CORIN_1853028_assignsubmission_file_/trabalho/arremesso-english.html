				<p class="texarre">It means that after the ball has left the pitcher's hand, he makes a takedown, normally it takes place inside the opponent's area and facing forward - quite common pitch between the pivots and eventually between the wingers.</p>

			<h3 id="rolamento">With bearing</h3>

				<p class="texarre">It means that after the ball has left the pitcher's hand, the pitcher performs a roll, most often a shoulder roll. This type of pitch is more common between wingers and eventually by pivots.</p>

			<h3 id="drible">Dribble</h3>

				<p class="texarre">It's the movement of hitting the ball against the ground with one hand while the player is still or moving.</p>

			<h3 id="ritmo">Three-phase rhythm</h3>

				<p class="texarre">It's considered as a fundament where the player takes three steps forward and towards the enemy goal in possession of the ball.</p>

			<h3 id="duplo">Three-phase double rhythm</h3>

				<p class="texarre">It is considered as a foundation where the player takes "seven" steps with possession of the ball, which must be carried out from the front, as follows: the first three steps are taken with possession of the ball immediately after the reception, and simultaneously in the execution of the fourth step the player will have to bounce the ball on the ground once, catch it again and take three more steps with the ball under control. At the end of the seventh stage he will have to pass or throw the ball. The first step must be performed with the leg opposite the arm that will perform the throw.</p>
